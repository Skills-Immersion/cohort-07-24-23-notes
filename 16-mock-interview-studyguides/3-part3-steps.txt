1. Find the api endpoint, test it on postman. Make sure you can find the data that the question is asking you to retrieve
2. Determine if the api endpoint is static or dynamic. Dynamic means the url can vary depending on the input given to the function. Eg: https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/bitcoin <----Bitcoin can vary depending on the input
3. Import axios if needed
4. Write the function and include any necessary parameters (if any)
5. Return the axios.get() call appropriately. Make sure the api endpoint is using the appropriate parameter (if any)
6. Make sure you return the data they are asking for in the .then()
7. Have a .catch() for any possible error handling
