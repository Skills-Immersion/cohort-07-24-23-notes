- Basic Terminology for HTML/CSS
  - Element vs Tags
  - Containers
    - divs are the general containers, but now we have more specialized containers for screen readers to be more specific like "nav", "section", "article"
    - divs are used to group related content together
  - Parent child relationships
    - Descendent vs direct child vs sibling
  - Inline elements vs block elements
    - Inline (Elements that do not create line breaks. Allows other elements to be next to it if there is enough space)
      - `<a>` (anchor/link)
      - `<span>` (generic inline container)
      - `<img>` (image)
    - Block (Elements that create line breaks and take up the line. Does not allow other elements to be next to it)

      - `<li>` (list item)
  - Selector - The code to target html elements in css 
  - Margin - space outside the container
  - Padding - space within the container

- Flexbox terminology:
  - display: flex
    - Gives a container access to flex-box properties. It will make the children of the container which has  display: flex set to be "flexible" and lets block elements be "side by side"
